    The land we gather on in our communities in Ktaqmkuk, traditional unceded Mi'Kaw territory. We hold in great respect the diverse histories  and cultures of the people
    of the Plate Cove area, and the ongoing connections with the past, present and future in our relationships with all people of the Plate Cove area in Newfoundland
    and Labrador.

    Plate Cove was first settled in the early 1800's largely by Irish Roman Cathloics from Bonavista and Kings Cove with English
    Roman Cathloics on the west side of the harbour. The consuses, directories, church, tax, fishing and voter records taken in
    the 1820 - 1940 timeframe indicate that the families that settled in Pplate Cove were Furlong, Keough, Driscoll, Dooley, Moss, Murphy, Philpot(Philpott),
    Russell, Tracey and Braker. There was also a family of Hogan's on the back side of Plate Cove West at Naked Man Beach. The family moved from the area around
    the early to mid 1900's with little known of why they left or where they went.

    Although originally known as Plate Cove, certain records indicated the destinction between Plate Cove East and Plate Cove West. In fact all voting registers and
    census records after 1900 make this distinction. By 1850 a minor but important road was built between PLate Cove and Kings Cove allowing people easier access to
    church services, visit and trade with other communities. A school was built in Open Hall around 1850 (approximately 6 miles from Plate Cove East).
    In the mid 1960's the road between Kings Cove and PLate Cove was improved to better link various small communities. Electricity was provided in 1964 and a
    telephone system was installed. Although there was only one phone to serve the needs of the community until a party line phone service was installed in 1968 that was
    shared bwteeen family members until individual phones were installed in the mid to late 1970's.

    In addition to the various fisheries. Plate Cove was surrounded by the best agricultural land in Bonnista South. Cattle, sheep, pigs, goats and poultry thrived on
    pastures, and crops grown around the two communities provided a surplus of dairy products, root crops, eggs and oats for other settlements in the
    vicinity. The importance to the region of the two communities is indicated by the fact that the only bulls found in Bonavista South in 1935, 19 in all, resided here.
