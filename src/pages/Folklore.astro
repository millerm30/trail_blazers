            According to urban legend, there are more than a few origin stories for the name "Jiggs Dinner". Once legend recalls the Newfoundlanders' adoration of a kitchen
            party and that they all love to dance and do a jig in the kitchen supposedly while the pot is on the boil.

            Another recalls that the salt beef, the most necessary item in the pot, was imported from New York by a company called Jiggs. One more suggests the way you would
            extract those boiled vegtables and bag of pease pudding out of the pot is reminiscent of jiggging a codfish.
            While the name "Jiggs Dinner" didn't come around until the turn of the 20<sup>th.</sup> century. It's components have long been part of the Newfoundland
            and Labrador culinary cannon.

          <p class="text-md">Tibb's Eve, Tip's Eve, Tipp's Eve, or Tipsy Eve are regional variations used throughout Newfoundland and Labrador to describe 
            the same celebration. Eventually, proverbial explanations arose as to when this non-existent Tibs Eve was: "Neither before nor after Christmas" was one. 
            "Between the old year and the new" was another. Thus, the day became associated with the Christmas season.
            Sometime around World War II, people along the south coast of Newfoundland began to associate 23 December with the phrase 'Tibb's Eve' and deemed 
            it the first night during Advent when it was appropriate to have a drink. Advent was a sober, religious time of year and traditionally people would 
            not drink alcohol until Christmas Day at the earliest. Tibb's Eve emerged as an excuse to imbibe two days earlier.
            For some people, Tib's Eve is the beginning of the Christmas season. Observed on December 23rd and sometimes called Tip's Eve or Tipsy Eve, 
            it's one of several extensions of the holidays. For many Newfoundlanders, this day is the official opening of Christmas, the first chance 
            to drink the Christmas stash. The date of Tib's Eve is only known in Newfoundland.
            The tradition of celebrating Tibb's Eve may be similar to 19th century workers taking Saint Monday off from work.

            An outport tradition not originally celebrated in St. John's, Tibb's Eve was adopted circa 2010 by local bar owners, who saw it as a business opportunity.
            Brewery taproom owners have suggested that hosting Tibb's Eve events allow them to open up "Newfoundland experiences to outsiders. 
            "The informal holiday has been also used for fundraising efforts, including the "Shine Your Light on Tibb's Eve" fundraiser for the St. John's Women's Centre, 
            first organized circa 2009 in St. John's, and Tibb's Eve charity drives organized by the Masons in Grand Bank, NL.
            Since then, social media and expatriate Newfoundlanders have spread the tradition to other parts of Canada, such as Halifax, Nova Scotia and Toronto, Ontario.
            In 2014, Grande Prairie Golf and Country Club in Alberta hosted a Newfoundland-themed Tibb's Eve event, in support of local charities. 
            In 2016, Folly Brewpub in Toronto brewed its own "Tibb's Eve" spiced ale. In 2019, comedian Colin Hollett described the holiday this way for a Halifax 
            <i>"Tibb's Eve on December 23, when people drink and eat at kitchen parties and bars with all the people they want to celebrate with before spending 
            time with those they have to. I have no idea how that isn't huge everywhere else."</i>
            The concept of the day being the "official" start of the Christmas holiday season was promoted in local media by 2020.
            In 2021, several Newfoundland bars hosted Tibb's Eve ugly Christmas sweater events,[29] while Port Rexton Brewery produced a "Tibbs the Saison" beer.

            If you live in Newfoundland, Sheila's Brush needs zero explanation. It is a storm, usually a big storm that occurs on or after St. Patrick's Day.
            It is typically the last big storm of the season.
            <img src={sheilasBushImage} class="float-right rounded m-4" />
            But who is Sheila? The term comes from an Irish legend that says that Sheila was the wife
            or sister or mother of St. Patrick and that the snow is a result of her sweeping away the old season, which is fitting since Spring begins later the week.
            There is also a legend that Sheila shows up to punish Newfoundlanders for the heavy partying that happens on St. Patrick's Day.
