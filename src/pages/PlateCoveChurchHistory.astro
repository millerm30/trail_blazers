      <p>
        Early settlers of Plate Cove would travel to Kings Cove and Open Hall in the 1800's to early 1900's for church services. Alot of early decendants of Plate Cove
        were burried in Open Hall until the graveyard was established in Plate Cove. The first person to be burried in the new
        Plate Cove graveyard was Mr. Charlie Tobin of Plate Cove West. Stories from early generations that it's residents couldn't travel the old road from Plate Cove 
        to Open Hall for the funeral services and burrials that the deceased were transported by boast or across the ice in the winter months. 
      <br><br>
        There was a school that ended up being used for church services in the early 1900's which ended up becoming a small local church used up until the new larger church
        was built in 1955 by local residents. St. Patrick's Parish was established in 1966 which used the church until it succumbed to a fire on November 16th. / 1986 that 
        completely destroyed the church and parish center. The community used the local St. Aiden Elementary School for weekly church services until a modern style church 
        was built. The new church offers a church, chapel, community center with stage, bathrooms and a kitchen. The present day church 
        is located between Plate Cove West and PLate Cove East and offers church services to present day.
